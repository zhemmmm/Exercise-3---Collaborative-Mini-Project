This project is a simple command-line based ToDo application developed as part of Exercise 3: Collaborative Mini-Project with Code Standards and Git Workflow. It was created to help us practice applying coding standards, improving user interface design, and collaborating effectively using Git branching, commits, and pull requests. The program allows users to add tasks, view their list of tasks, remove tasks by number, and exit the application. We also enhanced the user experience by improving the menu layout, adding icons and clear messages, and handling invalid inputs more gracefully.

To run this application, make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. Begin by cloning the repository from GitHub and navigating into the project folder using the terminal. Once inside the folder, you can launch the application by running the command python toDoApp.py. The menu will display options to add a task, show tasks, remove a task, or exit the program. Tasks are numbered for easy reference, and the application confirms each action with clear feedback to ensure a smoother interaction for the user.
